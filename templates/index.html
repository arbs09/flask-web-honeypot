  <h1>Welcome to My WordPress Site!</h1>
  <p>This is a basic WordPress website. Please excuse the outdated design, it hasn't been updated in a while.</p>
  <p>Here are some links that might be interesting (but they probably won't work):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="wp-login.php">Login</a> (This functionality might be broken)</li>
    <li><a href="wp-admin/">Admin Panel</a> (You probably shouldn't try this)</li>
    <li><a href="about.html">About Us</a> (This page might not exist)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Feel free to explore the site, but don't be surprised if things don't work perfectly. This is a work in progress (or maybe just neglected).</p>
